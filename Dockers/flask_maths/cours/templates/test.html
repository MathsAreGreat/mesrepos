	In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an
	algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

<p class="mb-2">
	It consists of a sequence of row-wise operations performed on the
	corresponding matrix of coefficients.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
	This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant
	of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777â€“1855).</p>
<p class="mb-2">
	To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row
	operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix
	is filled with zeros, as much as possible.
</p>
<ul>
	There are three types of elementary row operations:
	<li class="pl-10">Swapping two rows .</li>
	<li>Multiplying a row by a nonzero number .</li>
	<li>Adding a multiple of one row to another row .</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-2">
	Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper
	triangular matrix (possibly bordered by rows or columns of zeros), and in fact
	one that is in row echelon form.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
	Once all of the leading coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row)
	are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere,
	the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
	This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence
	of row operations used.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
	For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where two elementary
	operations on different rows are done at the first and third steps), the third
	and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is
	the unique reduced row echelon form. $$
	{\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&9\\1&1&-1&1\\3&11&5&35\end{bmatrix}}\to
	{\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&9\\0&-2&-2&-8\\0&2&2&8\end{bmatrix}}\to
	{\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&9\\0&-2&-2&-8\\0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}}\to
	{\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-2&-3\\0&1&1&4\\0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}} $$
